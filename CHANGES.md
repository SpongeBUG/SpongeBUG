## 🎨 Customization Priorities

### High Priority (Do These First)

1. **Update Personal Info** (README.md lines 18-27)
   ```typescript
   const ism = {
     location: "Philippines 🇵🇭",  // Update if needed
     currentFocus: [...],            // Update current projects
     learning: [...],                // Update what you're learning
     funFact: "..."                  // Make it personal!
   };
   ```

2. **Verify Social Links** (README.md lines 11-14)
   - LinkedIn URL
   - Twitter/X handle
   - Instagram handle

3. **Adjust Tech Stack** (README.md lines 35-92)
   - Add technologies you use
   - Remove ones you don't use
   - Reorder by proficiency

### Medium Priority (Do These Soon)

1. **Customize Color Scheme**

   - Reflect actual current work

3. **Adjust Stats Layout**

   - Add API key to GitHub secrets
   - Enable productivity.yaml workflow

2. **Pin Favorite Repositories**

- Check workflow logs for errors
- May take 24-48 hours initially

### Issue 4: Stats showing "Something went wrong"
**Solution:**
- Vercel API can be slow/rate-limited

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Load Time Optimization
1. **Use lazy loading for heavy images**
   ```markdown
   <img loading="lazy" src="..." />
   ```

2. **Compress GIFs** (if adding custom ones)
   - Use tools like ezgif.com
   - Keep under 500KB each

3. **Limit number of external API calls**
   - Current setup: ~10 external calls
   - All from reliable CDNs (Vercel, GitHub)

### GitHub Profile SEO
1. **Use descriptive text, not just emojis**
2. **Include keywords** (TypeScript, React, Full Stack)
3. **Keep README under 20KB** (current: ~15KB)
4. **Use alt text on images**
